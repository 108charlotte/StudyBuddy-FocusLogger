## StudyBuddy
This is a simple chrome extension designed to help students track their study time and be more productive! 

## Features
Includes a stopwatch which tracks time spent studying. There is a home screen that pops up when the user first opens the extension, which has a button to start this timer. When this button is clicked, it starts a timer running in background.js to ensure that the timer keeps running even when the extension is closed. During this time, there is also a javascript display file which retrieves the current time from the timer and displays it for the user to see. After closing the extension while a timer is currently running, when displaying the first page the javascript will check if a timer is currently running, and then display the running page so that the user can see how long their session has been running. Once they are done, they can click the done button and the session will show up in the table of previous sessions. Now, closing the extension will result in opening the start screen, not the running screen. 

** Please note that I started this project far before joining hack club so the hour-ish that shows for my project is NOT ACCURATE--this took A LOT OF TIME to code, especially since I am a beginner! 

## Credits
I used A LOT of chatGPT on this one--I didn't actually know any javascript starting off so I just used a lot of tutorials, but when tutorials failed to address the errors I was seeing, I turned to chatGPT.
